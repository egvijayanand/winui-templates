Join me on Developer Thoughts (https://egvijayanand.in/), an exclusive blog for articles on Xamarin.Forms, .NET MAUI and Blazor.

What's new in ver. 5.0.0.0:
---------------------------
Templates updated to support .NET 10 GA.

The default value for the Framework parameter is now set to .NET 10 (LTS).

So by default, the project command generates a .NET 10 project.

To create a .NET 8 or .NET 9 project, set the Framework parameter to .NET 8 (LTS) or .NET 9 (STS), respectively.

By default, the solution file is created in the SLNX format.

To use the classic SLN format, uncheck the SLNX UI control.

v4.5.0.0:

1. Templates updated to support .NET 10 RC2, and .NET MAUI 9 SR12.

2. Updates related to the WinUI Blazor project template:

* The MauiVersion can now be shown on any page, thanks to its refactoring into a control template.

Note: The following changes are relevant only when using the MAUI class library option, as .NET MAUI XAML is not compatible within the WinUI project.

It now includes support for two optional boolean inputs, shown as checkboxes in the UI, as outlined below.

* Global namespace is the default option for .NET MAUI 10.

But for smooth migration and to test backward compatibility, it can be opted out by unchecking the UI control.

* Support for implicit namespace option in project templates when targeting .NET MAUI 10.

Note: Both of the inputs are ignored in earlier versions (.NET 8/9).

v4.4.0.0:

The initial release of WinUI 3 Templates is now available as a VS Extension (VSIX) with support for Visual Studio 2022 and 2026 Insiders.

Comes with a set of templates for creating WinUI 3 related projects, including:

- WinUI 3 App
- WinUI 3 Hybrid App using .NET MAUI Native Embedding feature
- WinUI 3 Library

Item templates are also included for:

- WinUI 3 Page
- WinUI 3 User Control
- WinUI 3 Window

Note: The version # is aligned with its NuGet CLI Templates Pack counterpart.
